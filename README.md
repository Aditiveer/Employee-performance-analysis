# Employee-performance-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee performance and attrition trends using data science techniques including machine learning and deep learning.
Project Overview--The goal is to gain actionable insights into employee retention and performance through:
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2.Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
3.Predictive modeling using ML
4.Performance forecasting with Deep Learning
5.HR insights and data visualization

Dataset--The dataset contains information about employees, including:
1.Age
2.Department
3.Salary
4.Years at Company
5.Performance Score
6.Attrition (Yes/No)

Technologies Used:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
TensorFlow / Keras (neural networks)
Jupyter Notebook (analysis environment)

Key Features
EDA: Boxplots, pairplots, heatmaps, statistical summaries
Statistical Analysis: ANOVA, Bayes’ Theorem, attrition probabilities
ML Models:Logistic Regression for attrition classification,Random Forest Classifier,Linear Regression for performance score
Deep Learning:Feedforward Neural Network for regression,Binary classifier for attrition
Evaluation Metrics:Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, R², MSE
